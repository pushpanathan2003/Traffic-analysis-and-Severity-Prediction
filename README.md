# Traffic-analysis-and-Severity-Prediction
Traffic analysis and Severity Prediction is a Data-science project Using Python.The goal of this project is to
investigate and determine what causes accidents and what attributes to their level of severity.Through
visualizations and machine learning algorithms, areas of concern will be highlighted, and the seriousness of
accidents will be predicted as accurately as possible.
